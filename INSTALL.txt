Install
=======

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Python 3 (tested on 3.2).

Python libraries (these should be pulled by ``easy_install``):
    * Ply
    * sqlalchemy

Some RDBM system compatible with sqlalchemy (tested with postgreqsl and sqlite).

To run the tests, you need the ``nose`` framework.

Installation
++++++++++++

Yo can simply use ``easy_install``, from a command line::

    # easy_install terms

It is advisable to install it in a virtualenv.

Interfacing
+++++++++++

Once installed, you should have a ``terms`` script,
that provides a REPL. You invoke it with the name of a knowledge store,
that coresponds to a database in the RDBMS.
If you do not provide a name, it will default to "test".
You control which RDBMS to use with a config file,
``~/.terms.cfg``, with contents like::

    [db]
    dbms = postgres://terms:terms@localhost
    dbname = terms

If you omit this file, the db will default to an in-memory
sqlite db. If you specify another db, you must create it,
and the db user provided to Terms must be able to create
and drop tables.

So, for example, once you are set, open the REPL::

    eperez@calandria$ createdb testing
    eperez@calandria$ terms testing
    >>> a person is a thing.
    >>> loves is exists, subj a person, who a person.
    >>> john is a person.
    >>> sue is a person.
    >>> (loves john, who sue).
    >>> (loves john, who sue)?
    true
    >>> (loves sue, who john)?
    false
