Install
=======

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Python 3 (tested on 3.2).

Python libraries (these should be pulled by ``easy_install``):
    * ply
    * sqlalchemy

Some RDBM system compatible with sqlalchemy (tested with postgreqsl and sqlite).

To run the tests, you need the ``nose`` framework.

Installation
++++++++++++

Yo can simply use ``easy_install``, from a command line::

    # easy_install terms

It is advisable to install it in a virtualenv.

Interfacing
+++++++++++

Once installed, you should have a ``terms`` script,
that provides a REPL.
You control which RDBMS to use with a config file,
``~/.terms.cfg``, with contents like::

    [db]
    dbms = postgres://terms:terms@localhost
    dbname = terms

The default is::

    [db]
    dbms = sqlite://
    dbname = :memory:

You can invoke the terms script with the name of a knowledge store,
that coresponds to a database in the RDBMS,
and that overrides the ``dbname`` config setting.

The specified database must exist, and the terms user
must be able to create and drop tables and indexes.

So, for example, once you are set, open the REPL::

    eperez@calandria$ createdb testing
    eperez@calandria$ terms testing
    >>> a person is a thing.
    >>> loves is exists, subj a person, who a person.
    >>> john is a person.
    >>> sue is a person.
    >>> (loves john, who sue).
    >>> (loves john, who sue)?
    true
    >>> (loves sue, who john)?
    false
    >>> quit
    eperez@calandria$ terms testing
    >>> (loves john, who sue)?
    true
