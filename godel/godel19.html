<p>Another take, from <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200604/fea-davis.pdf">this essay</a>

<blockquote>
Incompleteness Theorem. Let F be a sound formal
system. Then there is a number n0 such that n0 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that Pn0 is provable in F.
</blockquote>

<p>Let's consider another formal system F'.
We can also prove that there is a number n1 such that n1 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that P'n1 is provable in F'.

<p>Should we merge both numbers and think of a single one for all F?
The problem is that the proof that Pn0 is not provable in F
is based on an enumeration of theorems in F,
and not in any F, but in the particular F that we trying to prove that Pn0 is not provable in.

<p>And, if we try to use n1 in the same proof with F and Pn1,
it will fail, because we already have n0 there to guarantee that K is uncomputable.

<p>So in effect, we have that the unprovable P are insulated in their formal systems.
