<p>Another take, from <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200604/fea-davis.pdf">this essay</a>

<blockquote>
  
There is a computable function  f whose range K is not computable.
  
   consider propositions
of the form 
n
∈
K
where 
n
is a fixed natural num-
ber. We can suppose that, in a particular formal sys-
tem these propositions are each represented by a
corresponding string of symbols we may write as
P
n

  
Let F be a sound formal
system. Then there is a number n0 such that n0 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that Pn0 is provable in F.
</blockquote>

<p>Let's consider another formal system F'.
We can also prove that there is a number n1 such that n1 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that P'n1 is provable in F'.

<p>Should we merge both numbers and think of a single one for all F?
The problem is that the proof that Pn0 is not provable in F
is based on an enumeration of theorems in F,
and not in any F, but in the particular F that we trying to prove that Pn0 is not provable in.
  
<p>So in principle, there is no reason to consider them equal. And, if we try to build it (them),
  it will be a construction, like Gödel's, that depends on the particular F,
  so it will be most surely different if we use different F.

<p>Furthermore, if we try to use n1 in the same proof with F and Pn1,
it will fail, because we already have n0 there to guarantee that K is uncomputable in F.
