Hey you Muscovite friend!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

I see you are going through the Terms documentation,
and I would love to know your impressions about it.
If you read this, I encourage you to drop me a line
at enriquepablo@gmail.com, and tell me what you think,
ask me whatever is not clear in the docs, get support,
start some collaboration,
or anything at all.
Thanks for your interest anyway!
