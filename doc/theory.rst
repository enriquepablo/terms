The formal theory behind Terms
==============================


The intended interpretation of the theory is a certain subset of the natural language (NL),
so the first thing I need to show is a clear and consistent structure
in the broad and muddy phenomenon of the NL, that can serve as a model for our theory.
In this structure I largely ignore the semantics of the NL,
and focus mainly on its grammatical side.
This grammar is not intended to cover all natural constructions,
only to cover enough of them to allow us to express complex discourses.

Within NL, we distinguish two types of sentence: copulas and facts.
In copulas, we establish a relation between 2 words.
We distinguish 2 forms of copular words:
those in which 



The individuals in NL will be words,



I will propose a simple grammar able to produce something recognizable as English sentences,
that doesn't pretend to cover even a fraction of the real language,
but that allows us to express complex things, such as
the requirements of a software project
or the theory of evolution of Darwin.
